You might have already heard about the release of the new xAI model, Grok 4, another groundbreaking model from Elon Musk.

In this post, we'll do a deep dive into what this model is, its stats, whether it is any good or just another regular AI model, if it achieves AGI, and if it’s even worth giving a shot.

By the end of this post, you'll have all the information you need to decide whether you want to use Grok 4 or not.

Without any further ado, let's jump in!

## Brief on Grok 4

Grok 4 is a reasoning model and the most intelligent model so far. To be honest, this model not only competes with other AI models but also with humans, making it the first of its kind (we'll discuss this shortly).

It comes with a 256k token context window, which is quite low compared to the recent Gemini 2.5 Pro with a 1M token context window. It's just a bit ahead of the Claude 4 lineup, which has about 200k tokens.

Grok 4 pricing is not in the expensive tier. It's the same as the pricing for Grok 3 at $3/million input tokens and $15/million output tokens.

### Some key benchmarking results of Grok 4:

1. This model scores an all-time high in GPQA Diamond with 88%, which is a big win over the 86% from Gemini 2.5 Pro.
2. It achieves an all-time high score in the Humanity Last Exam with 24%, beating Gemini 2.5 Pro's previous score of 21%.
3. It has the joint highest score for MMLU-Pro and AIME 2024 at 87% and 94%, respectively.
4. As you guessed, it also crushes the coding benchmarks, ranking **#1 in the LiveCodeBench** with 79.4%, where the second best is 74.2%.

Yeah, there are a few other benchmarks where it leads all the models, but these are pretty much the most interesting ones. You can find all of them on the internet.

So all in all, currently, if you take any benchmarks, most probably Grok 4 is leading all of them. Yes...🥴

But how do you access it? It's available via both API and a paid subscription. You can access it on SuperGrok for $30/month or $300/year, which gives you access to standard Grok 4. However, to access **Grok 4 Heavy**, you need to subscribe to the SuperGrok Heavy plan, which costs $300/month or $3000/year.

Even better, if you just want to test the models, it's also available on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), so if you have an API key, you're good to go.

## Does it achieve AGI?

If you're not sure what AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is, let me give you a brief idea. Basically, Generative AI, which we use, like the OpenAI models, Claude Sonnet models, and others, generates content based on learned patterns or what they've been trained on.

However, AGI generates content consciously, with creativity comparable to human intelligence. 🤯

And let me tell you, my friend, this is not something you can build out of nowhere just like that, no. Here we're talking about reaching artificial intelligence equivalent to the human brain, and that's not easily achieved.

Even if you don't feel like it (and I know you do, just kidding! 😆), your brain is super powerful, and trying to take something **artificial** to that level is super out of this world.

Now back to the topic, it has not yet achieved AGI, but it is one leap forward in the race to AGI, and the first model to cross the **15% score** in the ARC-AGI benchmark.

There's no comparison between Grok 4 and the other AI models here, and it's doing it all at a lower price. So yeah, this is one great step to AGI, but simply not there yet.

## How good it really is and is it even worth it?

Grok 4 is officially the most intelligent AI model on earth right now! I guess that gives you your answer.

![grok4_highest_int.jpg](/blog/grok4_highest_int.jpg)

Most of us mainly care about the model's performance in coding tests, and let me tell you, I've tested it myself; it works pretty well, but I didn't find it much better than the Claude 4 lineup. However, it's good.

Musk himself has claimed that you can copy and paste your entire source code into a query, and it will fix bugs or add features for you, just like that. It's also claimed to work **"better than Cursor"**.

![Grok "better than Cursor" claim](/blog/grok-better-than-cursor-claim.png)

And again, that seems to be true enough. The community is building a lot of stuff with this model since it was released less than a week ago, and the results we're getting are insane.

It literally one-shotted something that crazy, and if that's not enough, it's literally said to be better than PhD levels in every subject. Let that sink in.

## When would you want to use Grok 4?

Based on the benchmarks we have and the community impressions so far, it seems like it's a one-stop place for anything you'd want to go for.

But still, I wouldn't recommend you use this model for minimal basic stuff.

Also, there have been recorded cases where it actually can cause some trouble, and by that, I mean that this model is recorded to have the highest "snitch rate" of any LLM ever released.

![grok4_snitch.jpg](/blog/grok4_snitch.jpg)

It could try contacting the government or the media, so use it with caution. 😬

Make sure that you don't give this model access to unnecessary tool calls and mainly use it for research or other intelligent tasks because, as you guessed, it's the most intelligent model.

## Conclusion

If I have to summarize everything we've read so far, it's definitely the best model available that you can get for any task (at least for now!).

This one's definitely the biggest breakthrough in the AI world so far, with the claim that it's supposedly the closest model to reach AGI so far. So yeah, there's definitely a lot of potential in this model, so use it with caution.

With great power comes great responsibility! 😉

Let me know what you think of Grok 4 so far, and if you've tested it yourself, how it performed. Let me know in the comments below!

## Try Grok 4 on Forge

We've recently added support for Grok 4 on Forge. If this sounds interesting to you, you'll definitely want to try it on Forge. You can [create an account](https://app.forgecode.dev/) and get started in just a minute. See for yourself if it performs as well as the benchmarks suggest and if you’d like to add this model to your daily workflow.
