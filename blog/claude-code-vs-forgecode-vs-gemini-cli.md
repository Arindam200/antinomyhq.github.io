After putting Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Forge Code through identical real-world coding challenges, I've discovered multiple differences that could make or break your development workflow. Here's what I found when testing each tool on different scenarios, from creating new UI components to fixing broken apps.

## TL;DR

If you want to jump straight to the conclusion, here's my opinion.

Each AI tool excels in different parts of the dev workflow:

- Use **Claude Code** for production-level reliability. It makes safe, focused edits, handles React patterns well, and rarely breaks things when debugging. If you're working in real apps with real users, this is the one to trust.
- Use **Forge Code** if you're dealing with large codebases, cross-file bugs, or messy state logic. Its deeper context understanding and multi-model support help it restructure broken logic with confidence.
- Use **Gemini CLI** for fast prototyping, scaffolding, or UI-heavy tasks. It’s free, has a 1M token context window, and generates clean layouts with minimal effort, great for frontloaded design work.

## Test Methodology

I designed my comparison around three real-world tasks, each targeting a different dimension of how coding tools perform in practical development. The first tested how well they present and structure user interfaces, the second challenged their ability to handle interactive logic in a visual setting, and the third evaluated how deeply they can understand and debug interconnected files in a broken codebase.

## CLI Tools Comparison

Let’s compare these three tools in coding.

### 1. Landing Page (UI & Structure)

**Prompt:**

```jsx
Create a modern SaaS landing page for a product called CloudSync. It should include a hero section, a features grid, testimonials, pricing, and a footer. Focus only on UI layout, functionality isn’t required.
```

**Claude Code:**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/claude-code/landing-page).

Here’s the output:

![Retro Runner Comparison 3](/static/images/blog/claude_code_demo.gif)

Claude produced a structurally complete layout. Each section was implemented, and internal anchor links worked as expected. However, the visual elements were minimal, like emojis were used instead of icons, and the overall style lacked the refinement needed for a polished SaaS landing page. It handled the layout correctly, but the UI needed improvement.

**Forge Code:**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/forge-code/landing-page).

Here’s the output:

![Retro Runner Comparison 3](/static/images/blog/forgecode_demo.gif)

Forge included all required sections and added several enhancements such as animated statistics, accessibility features, and a multi-link footer. The layout followed a logical structure, and the design leaned toward a more enterprise-style aesthetic. However, improvement is needed in hover effects, and the hamburger toggle and animated statistics sometimes behave unexpectedly during loading.

**Gemini CLI**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/gemini-cli/landing-page).

Here’s the output:

![Demo](/static/images/blog/gemini_cli_demo.gif)

The response included all required sections, with clean structure and consistent spacing throughout. It used Tailwind CSS, added hover effects, and applied subtle animations that didn't interfere with readability. The layout was responsive, icons were used appropriately, and the code was well-organized.

### 2. Endless Runner Game (Visual Logic)

**Prompt:**

```jsx
Create a retro-style endless runner game using p5.js. The player should jump over obstacles using the spacebar, and the game should track the score and get faster over time. Add a pixel art style background.
```

**Gemini CLI**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/gemini-cli/retro-endless-running).

Here’s the output:

![demo](/static/images/blog/retro_runner_comparision_gemini.gif)

Gemini produced a playable setup, but it didn’t meet several core expectations. The player and enemies were represented as simple square shapes without clear visual differentiation. Speed remained static throughout the run, and while the score counter worked, it was the only dynamic element present. The jump mechanic also felt off, the delay in returning to the ground made the game less responsive.

**Claude Code**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/claude-code/retro-endless-running).

Here’s the output:

![Demo](/static/images/blog/retro_runner_comparision_claude.gif)

Claude’s version included core mechanics: enemy movement, score tracking, and player jump behavior. The game ended correctly upon collision. While the animations worked, some visual polish was missing — for instance, scores were shown in raw decimal format instead of using `toFixed`. The enemy speed scaled appropriately, and the player character had basic movement details like leg motion.

**Forge Code**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/forge-code/retro-endless-running).

Here’s the output:

![demo](/static/images/blog/retro_runner_comparision_forgecode.gif)

Forge introduced visual variety using graphics that resembled retro characters. The score updated properly, and the game speed increased gradually as expected. It also stored the high score in localStorage and added subtle visual details like different player expressions during gameplay and on collision. The game’s difficulty scaled well over time, which made it more engaging.

### 3. Multi-File Code Debugging (Contextual Reasoning)

**Prompt**

```jsx
My app, art-log, is not working as expected. It has all the logic written but has some issues. Please check the errors, identify the problems, and fix them all.
```

![Code](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w1av8j1e43ijlnau7wfe.png)

**Code Issue Summary:**

- `blogId` is undefined in `Editor.tsx`
- `BlogProvider` is missing in `main.tsx`
- `useContext` is used unsafely without null checks
- `saveDraft` is missing from `useEffect` dependencies

The Code:

```jsx
// src/BlogContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

interface BlogContextType {
  content: string | null;
  setContent: (value: string) => void;
  saveDraft: (content: string, blogId: string) => void;
}

export const BlogContext = createContext<BlogContextType | null>(null);

export const BlogProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  const [content, setContent] = useState<string | null>("Hello world!");

  const saveDraft = (content: string, blogId: string) => {
    console.log(`Saving draft for blog ${blogId}:`, content);
  };

  return (
    <BlogContext.Provider value={{ content, setContent, saveDraft }}>
      {children}
    </BlogContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useBlog = () => {
  const ctx = useContext(BlogContext);
  if (!ctx) throw new Error("useBlog must be used within a BlogProvider");
  return ctx;
}

// src/useAutosave.ts
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { BlogContext } from "./BlogContext";
import { useContext } from "react";

export const useAutosave = (content: string, blogId: string) => {
  const { saveDraft } = useContext(BlogContext); // will throw if context is null (and is null in current setup)

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (content && blogId) saveDraft(content, blogId);
    }, 2000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [content, blogId]);
};

// src/Editor.tsx
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { BlogContext } from "./BlogContext";
import { useAutosave } from "./useAutosave";

export const Editor = () => {
  const { content, setContent } = useContext(BlogContext); // ❌ may be null (type allows it)

  //  blogId is never defined or passed
  useAutosave(content || "", blogId); // blogId is undefined

  return (
    <textarea
      value={content || ""}
      onChange={(e) => setContent(e.target.value)}
      rows={10}
      cols={50}
    />
  );
};

// src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Editor } from "./Editor";

//  Forgot to wrap with <BlogProvider>
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Editor />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

```

**Response from Forge Code**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/forge-code/multi-file-debug).


![Forge Code](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/awhqnisltyh6auefnfz7.png)


Forge completely tracked the broken app flow across files and rewrote everything to work together. It read all four files, understood the broken app flow, and systematically rewrote the context, hook, and Editor to fix everything. It also separated logic into new files to resolve Fast Refresh issues, handled type import edge cases, and even added `localStorage` `persistence` for autosaves.

**Response from Claude Code**

Claude made a solid set of targeted improvements. It replaced all `useContext` calls with a safer custom `useBlog` hook fixed the missing `BlogProvider` wrapper in `main.tsx`, and handled the undefined `blogId` by adding a default value. It also included `saveDraft` in the dependency array of the autosave hook to avoid stale closures and improved the textarea UX with a helpful placeholder.

**Response from Gemini CLI**

You can find the generated code here: [Link](https://github.com/Studio1HQ/AI-Terminal-Tools-Comparison/tree/main/gemini-cli/multi-file-debug)

![Gemini CLI](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hgmmycq2sse28lsjcsgg.png)

Gemini attempted a full restructure: it removed the redundant `context.tsx`, refactored everything to use a `useBlog` hook, introduced a new `Blog.tsx` component, and updated all imports and providers. The steps looked solid, but the result was far from production-ready. The app still failed to compile, throwing multiple TypeScript errors like missing `BlogContext`, undefined `content`, `setContent`, and `saveDraft` on empty objects, clearly showing that the context shape was never properly typed or initialized. Even after 10+ minutes of edits, Gemini left the app broken at runtime, and it never restructured the logic deeply enough to make the changes coherent.

## Which one should you choose?

| Feature | Claude Code | Forge Code | Gemini CLI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Context Understanding** | Reads codebase, understands relationships | Reads everything, thinks through connections | Struggles with multi-file context |
| **Code Safety** | Conservative edits, won't break existing code | Bold changes, sometimes over-engineers | Unpredictable, can break working code |
| **Problem Solving** | Methodical, addresses root causes | Creative solutions, adds enhancements | Surface-level fixes, misses deeper issues |
| **UI/Visual Work** | Functional but basic styling | Good structure, some visual bugs, but mobile first approach | Strong visual design, responsive layouts |
| **Debugging Skills** | Excellent at finding and fixing specific issues | Good at complete refactors | Weak at complex multi-file problems |
